# Steganography

The Steganography project implemented in Python focuses on concealing sensitive information within digital media files using various techniques, including LSB (Least Significant Bit) embedding, Huffman coding, and a combination of LSB and Huffman coding.

The LSB technique involves replacing the least significant bit of each pixel in an image or the least significant sample in audio with the secret message bits. This approach ensures that the hidden message remains visually or audibly imperceptible to casual observers.

To further enhance the security and efficiency of data embedding, the project incorporates Huffman coding. This data compression algorithm assigns variable-length codes to different characters based on their frequency of occurrence. By applying Huffman coding, the storage of the hidden information is optimized, reducing its overall footprint within the cover media.

In addition, the project explores the combination of LSB and Huffman coding to achieve an even higher level of security. This approach involves hiding the Huffman-encoded secret message within the cover media using the LSB technique. By combining both techniques, robust information concealment is ensured while maintaining compression efficiency.

The Python implementation provides a user-friendly interface where users can select the desired steganography technique, input their secret message, and choose the cover media file. The application then performs the necessary encoding or decoding operations, seamlessly embedding or extracting information from the digital media.

With this steganography project, users can securely communicate and protect sensitive data by leveraging the power of LSB embedding, Huffman coding, and their combination. It offers a practical and effective solution for confidential information hiding within digital media files.
