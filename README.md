# Steganography

The Steganography project implemented in Python aims to explore and compare three different algorithms for concealing sensitive information within digital media files. The algorithms studied include LSB (Least Significant Bit) embedding, Huffman coding, and a combination of LSB and Huffman coding.

LSB embedding involves replacing the least significant bit of each pixel in an image or the least significant sample in audio with the secret message bits. This technique ensures that the hidden message remains visually or audibly imperceptible to casual observers.

Huffman coding, on the other hand, is a data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to different characters based on their frequency of occurrence. By utilizing Huffman coding, the storage of the hidden information is optimized, reducing its overall footprint within the cover media.

To determine the effectiveness and efficiency of these techniques, the project includes a comparative analysis. By comparing the performance of LSB embedding, Huffman coding, and the combination of both techniques, users can gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

The Python implementation provides a user-friendly interface where users can select the desired steganography algorithm, input their secret message, and choose the cover media file. The application then performs the necessary encoding or decoding operations, enabling users to observe the results and evaluate the performance of each algorithm.

By comparing the three algorithms, users can make informed decisions about which technique suits their specific requirements. Whether prioritizing security, compression efficiency, or a balance between the two, this project provides valuable insights into the capabilities of LSB embedding, Huffman coding, and their combined usage.

The Steganography project offers an opportunity to explore, analyze, and compare different algorithms, empowering users to make informed choices when it comes to securely hiding sensitive information within digital media files.
